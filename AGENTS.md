# Agent Guidelines for City_Hive

This repository is often updated with the help of coding assistants. To keep contributions consistent, follow these conventions:

- Keep documentation in Markdown under the project root.
- Run `black` on any modified Python files and use 2â€‘space indentation for JavaScript.
- There are no automated tests; manually load `docs/index.html` after changes to ensure the map still works.
- When updating features, also update `README.md` and `Roadmap.md`.
- Use clear commit messages describing the change.
