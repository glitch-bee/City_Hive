# Bee Tree and Swarm Trap Mapping Project - Outline

## Project Goal:

Create an interactive map for NYC beekeepers to:

* Tag locations of “bee trees” (hollow, inhabited, or likely trees)
* Mark recommended or attempted swarm trap sites
* Leverage public tree data and user input for improved swarm monitoring and collaboration

## Key Features:

* NYC base map using Leaflet.js (or similar)
* Overlay of NYC street trees from the NYC Open Data Tree Census (CSV/GeoJSON/API)
* Ability for users to tag/map:

* “Bee Trees” (feral colony sightings or likely hollows)
* Swarm Trap locations (current/past/possible, with notes)
* Optional: Attach brief notes or photo to a tagged location
* Visualization filters (species, borough, date, etc.)

## Data Sources:

* NYC Tree Census (public dataset)
* User-submitted data (uploaded via form, CSV, or map click)
* Optional: Photos/descriptions submitted by users

## Implementation Steps:

1. Download sample tree data (single borough/neighborhood for pilot)
2. Display tree points as interactive markers or clusters
3. Build input method for users to tag bee trees/trap sites (form or map click)
4. Store user data in a simple, club-accessible CSV or Google Sheet
5. Merge user tags with the map for display
6. Gather feedback and iterate for broader deployment

## Safeguards and Responsible Use:

* Only allow approximate locations (nearest intersection or block, not exact tree if sensitive)
* Anonymize user-submitted data; do not collect names/emails publicly
* Restrict “bee tree” submissions to club members, or moderate before public display
* Educational notice: Encourage users not to disturb feral colonies or trespass
* Optional: Approval process or review for new tags before they appear on the public map
* Limit display of precise locations for rare or especially vulnerable trees

## Next Steps:

* Present outline and pilot to club for feedback
* Identify a neighborhood or borough to test
* Assign volunteers for initial data gathering and review
* Explore partnerships with local ecology groups or NYC Parks if expanding beyond club use
