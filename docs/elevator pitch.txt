Project: bee_tree
Mapping wild pollinators in urban spaces

bee_tree is a lightweight, browser-based dashboard designed to visualize feral honey bee sightings in relation to New York City's urban forestry. 
Built using Python for backend data processing and HTML/JavaScript for the frontend, it integrates open datasets like the NYC Street Tree Census to identify ecological relationships between tree species and wild colony nesting sites.

Unlike hive registries, bee_tree focuses exclusively on feral colonies, aiming to support urban beekeepers, researchers, and land stewards with insights into habitat preferences, seasonal activity, and potential conservation opportunities.

Key features:

Parsing and filtering large public datasets (e.g., street tree DBH, species)

Interactive mapping of bee sightings with layered tree data

User-defined markers for structures (e.g., sheds, buildings) as potential nest sites

Data protection strategies to obscure precise hive locations

Year-over-year tracking to identify long-term trends and ecological patterns

Currently in development, bee_tree is intended as a resource for the New York Bee Club, with potential utility for city agencies like NYC Parks or academic partners focused on urban ecology and pollinator health.
